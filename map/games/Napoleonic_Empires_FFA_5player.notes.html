<H1>Napoleonic Empires Free-For-All 5 Players <br>by Veqryn<br></H1>   <br>Free-For-All win conditions (by Victory Cities): <br>Nation ..... Projection of Power / Honorable Surrender / Total Victory <br>France ..... 7 / 8 / 10 <br>U.K. ........ 7 / 8 / 10 <br>Austria ..... 7 / 8 / 10 <br>Ottoman ... 7 / 8 / 10 <br>Russia ...... 7 / 8 / 10 <br> <br> <br>Main Differences between FFA version and Normal Version: <br>Politics is added, you can change your alliances. <br>When capturing a capital, you destroy the PUs rather than capture the PUs. <br>Every nation has a national objective to encourage attacking. <br> <br> <br>General FFA rules: <br>#1. Limit yourself to 5 minute turns, negotiate on other people's turns not yours. Try to play quickly. <br>#2. Only 1 person can win, so conduct your diplomacy accordingly.  If you do get backstabbed, try to be a good sport, and do not take it personally,     everyone should backstab and be backstabbed eventually.  <br>#3. No giving your capitol to a player. If your capital gets taken, and you have no chance to take it back for good, then you have have lost the game.      Command your armies until they are no more, or ask to be replaced by an AI. <br>#4. Have fun! (place your bids in a balanced fashion...diplomacy sometimes fails!  Do Not be a bad sport! Suiciding yourself IS being a bad sport.). <br>#5. Because there are lots of players, there is a chance someone will disconnect. Meet back in the lobby and start your game up again with the latest autosave.     be patient. Don't leave, thats just lame! <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> The empires of europe are at war. <br><br>  The upstart French republic has followed in the footsteps of their American compatriots across the sea and cast off the trappings of monarchy. <br> Can this new light in europe survive against a host of squabbling adversaries? <br> Or will it fall victim to its own aspirations for empire...<br> Will the russians be forced to sing La Marseillaise? <br> Will the English see the Guillotine raised in Piccadilly?<br> Or will the rule of the monarchs be insured by the restoration of Louis XVIII to the Parisian throne?<br><br><br>    CANALS:<br> Oresund (Holstein,Sjaelland)(SZ10,SZ11)<br> Kerch Straight (Crimea,Astrakahn)(SZ97,SZ101)<br> Strait of Messina (Sicily,Calabria)(SZ70,SZ71)<br> Neva River (Karelia,Ingria)(SZ2,SZ3)(Russia can build navy in the lake)<br> Bosphorus (Constantinople,Kiutayeh)(SZ84,SZ92)(connects Turkey, Balkans by land)<br><br>   UNITS and RULES:<br> Battleships DO NOT REPAIR at end of turn.<br> The number of Bombardments allowed is restricted to the number of units making an amphibious assault, however bombardments still kill units without the unit getting to return fire.<br> Extra Units are available starting on round 2. Un-check the game option 'Use Triggers' to turn off these units permanently.<br> Encampments are permanent, and can be captured.<br> Generals can move and raise troops in the territory they occupy, IF you owned that territory at the beginning of your turn.<br> Generals, Encampments, and Capitals are Factories, meaning they follow all normal factory rules.  They can be purchased and placed anywhere you owned at beginning of turn, they can produce anywhere you owned at beginning of turn, and they can be captured<br> Barques (green transports) are not able to capture convoy zones.<br> Capturing a Convoy Zone denies the enemy their income, but does not provide you with any income, and can only be done during your Combat Move.<br> <br> Victory Conditions:<br> Depends on the nations.<br> <br><br>   Actual Alliances in this game:<br> There are no permanent alliances.....<br><br>  Historical Alliances:<br> Nation................................

PRU AUS UK<br> (Light Blue = Neutral Nations, which can be attacked by anyone and everyone)<br>  <br> <br>Politics National Objective: <br>+4 PUs per turn that you attack and destroy as least one enemy unit. <br>This represents the morale boost your nation receives for victories on the battlefield, however small. <br>As light blue Neutral Nations are not aggressors in this conflict, they are not counted towards destroyed enemy TUV, which means you must attack actual players to get this bonus. <br>(Both ships and land units count, and you are not required to win the battle) <br> <br> <br>When Political Actions become available: <br>Moving from - Moving to - take X rounds (including current round) <br>War - Ceasefire - 2 rounds <br>Ceasefire - Open Borders - 1 rounds <br>Open Borders - Allied - 1 rounds <br>Ceasefire - War - 1 rounds <br>Open Borders - War - 2 rounds <br>Open Borders - Ceasefire - 1 rounds <br>Allied - Ceasefire - 2 rounds <br>Allied - Open Borders - 1 rounds <br> <br>This means someone can go directly from Open Borders to War, so long as they wait 2 rounds after the Open Borders agreement was signed. <br>And someone can go directly from Allied to Ceasefire, so long as they wait 2 rounds after the Alliance was signed. <br>There is no way to go directly from Allied to War, as you must pass through either Ceasefire *OR* Open Borders to get to War. <br>  <br> <br>Unit List: <br>attack/defense/movement/cost .... special <br>1/2/1/4 Fusiliers .

Corvettes can retreat separately from the main force during offense, and can retreat when on the defense to any adjacent friendly/empty sea zone. <br>Fortresses and Towers are normal units, and as such they must be placed with a factory of some kind (a general, encampment, or capital) <br> <br> <br>STRATEGY HELP and OPENING MOVES <br> <br>On Units: <br>Barques are the Green-Bottom boats, and they are the Transports of this game. <br>Fusiliers and Howitzers are the most efficient units to buy.  If bought in pairs, they are essentially 3att/3def/1mov/8cost with 2 hit points (Hitpoints matter alot!). <br>Cutters and Brigantines/Corvettes are the most efficient naval units to buy.  If bought in pairs, they are essentially 3att/3def/2mov/14cost with 2 hit points, (or 4/2/2/15 if cutter + corvette, assuming you have ships for the cutter to support). <br> <br>As France: <br>You have many options and no required opening moves. <br>Obviously you should take Flanders, Cologne, and Provence. <br>Option 1) Go Heavy into Germany and NorthWestern Europe <br>Option 2) Go Heavy into Italy <br>Option 3) Atlantic Fleet builds <br>Option 4) Med Fleet builds <br>Option 5) Take Egypt and Optionally build an encampment or general down there. <br>Option 6) Send the Egypt fleet back towards Italy (or up to black sea) <br>Generally speaking you can probably do 2-3 out of those 6, as trying to do more would spread you too thin. <br> <br>As England: <br>You have the most options and no required opening moves. <br>Try to kill the remains of the english channel french fleet. <br>You can use the frigate near ireland for shore bombardments into ireland (with the marine), and even help with the northumberland marine too. <br>Your Majorica fleet can kill the spanish fleet if the french did not support it, and otherwise you can take corsica, sardinia, valencia, or tunisia with the marines there, or you can head for the french convoy zone and steal it. <br>Your other med fleet can go towards the french med fleet, or try to link up with the majorica fleet, or head to Candia (crete).  You can also build an encampment in either Candia or Majorica, though Candia can usually last longer, and can be used to pressure the ottomons. <br>England should try to have more fleet than the spanish at all times. <br>It is generally a good idea to help the Prussians push Sweden out of Jutland.  After that, you can turn your attention to northern france, northwestern europe, or invade norway and sweden. <br>Get the Swedish and French convoy zones near England as soon as you can. <br> <br>As Austria: <br>Do not forget to move your troops in Hollande (and each turn after that until they get where you want them to go). <br>Take Bavaria and Venetia. <br>You can also take 1 Ottomon territory this turn most likely. <br>Build cheap units as fodder. <br>Sit back and build, perpare for french assault eventually.  Play check with French forces. <br>You can also swing into Italy when the time is right and the French are not prepared to prevent you taking Rome. <br>Pressuring Ottomons can be done but is risky, as if you get too far away from Vienna the French might decided to take it from you. <br> <br>As The Ottomons: <br>Retreat northern forces closer to Constantinople. <br>Move Brigantine in SZ93 closer to Russian Convoy, take russian convoy on turn 2 with brig. <br>You use your marines against an enemy in moldovia, or you can move them to use turn 2 or 3 in the med against the neutrals. <br>If you pick up your general with the barque and drop him off in Sinop, you can build a cavalry there and use it against Armenia. <br>You can attack Edessa first turn, but if you lose any guys taking Armenia turn 2 gets more painful.  Might be worth waiting and moving all troops closer to Armenia turn 1 without attacking. <br>Overall, your goal is take significant money out of the middle east, while holding off Russian hordes, Austrian adventuring, and the occasional UK amphibious assault. <br>Survive long enough while taking neutrals and you become a threat who can push back, but at the beginning you mostly just try to survive.   <br>If Austria does not send much against you, or Sweden forces Russia to head north, you can go on an early offensive, but don't get in over your head. <br>You can also send all your navy to the med and challenge the UK for supremecy there. <br> <br>As Russia: <br>Your job is to push Sweden out of Finland, and Push the Ottomons out of Armenia, while threatening and holding down any Ottomons near Constantinople that way they do not pressure Austria.  You can also send a few spare troops to defend Prussia and Austrian capitols. <br>Pretty simple, you want to send at least 20 units north.... then send everything else south. <br>If Prussia is not going navy, you will need to send a unit north every turn just to build up a defense up there in case sweden attacks.  <br>Otherwise, send everything you build south every turn. <br>You can also send a general south and build Navy.  After you take the two neutrals there, your navy can exit the harbor and take back your convoy zone.  The navy builds often force the Ottomons to keep up in navy, which is not something they can easily do. <br>Mordvins does touch sz101, so you can build navy with a general there. <br>SZ2 touches SZ3, and a general in Novgorod can build a fleet in sz2 that Sweden can not touch until you are prepared to exit the lake and attack Sweden's fleet. It is difficult to for Russia to defeat Sweden alone, and it is much better to have UK or Prussia attack Sweden at the same time. <br> <br> <br> <br>Optional Rules: <br>Optional Rule: Turn on 'Units Can Be Destroyed Instead Of Captured' to have the following effect: Captured Generals are executed, Encampments burned to the ground, and Capitals razed (if a player loses their capital, then regains it, they must build a camp or general there in order to produce there). <br>Optional Canal: Andalusia (Gibralter) must be controlled to move between SZ53-54 <br>Optional Andalusia (Gibraltar) rules: Gibraltar does not touch any land, therefor no units can enter it by land, and no units may exit it onto land.  Must be invaded by ship. <br> <br> <br> <br>Version 2.0 - 4.x changes made by Veqryn. <br> <br> <br>Changes for FFA version only: <br>Lots more neutral units in southern Italy, Africa, and the Middle East. <br>Different Victory Conditions for each player, check above or in game options screen <br>Small changes to unit placement. <br>Nations now destroy their PUs instead of letting them be captured (FFA only). <br> <br>Changes for 5 player version: <br>Removed Spain, Prussia, and Sweden, converting their units to neutrals and adding a lot more neutrals. <br>Changing values of territories around slightly so all nations begin almost equal. <br>Changing some territory ownership, adding new units for existing players, including a fleet by Tangiers for Ottomans. <br>Increasing values of most convoy zones to 8. <br> <br> <br> <br>Version 4.1.x changes: <br>renamed from Napoleonic Empire to Napoleonic Empires. <br>Changed default skin to political map. <br>Removed custom cursor. <br>Changed show territory names to true. <br>Renamed around 12 territories. <br> <br> <br>Version 4.0 - 4.0.x changes: <br>Tweaking of Political rules. <br>Increasing Mortar defense by 1, and increasing cost by 1. <br>Decreased Fortress cost by 1. <br>Increasing Marshal movement by 1 (to 3) so that they match the other special cavalry. <br>Decreasing cost of Generals and Encampments by 1. <br> <br> <br>Version 3.9.x - 4.0 changes: <br>Added politics, allowing dynamic changing of relationships during the game. <br>Game now starts according to historical alliances, but using Ceasefire instead of Allied so that people can switch to war if they want to. <br> <br> <br>Version 3.8 - 3.9 changes: <br>Removed connection between Bohus and sz21. <br>Added two fortresses to Majorca. <br>Changed a single tower and fortress on Candia into three Chasseurs. <br>Removed a Tower from Catalonia. <br>Updated to new engine:  <br>Barques (the transports) no longer capture convoy zones, while all other boats still can. <br>Now uses Triggers to prevent purchases of Marshals, Mortars, Towers and Fortresses before the 2nd turn. <br>Added ability to have generals, encampments, and capitals destroyed with a game option. <br> <br> <br>Version 3.7 - 3.8 changes: <br>Changed Default Victory Condition to be honorable surrender (13 vc), instead of total victory (14). <br>Removed 1 defense from the Mortar unit, so now it is zero defense (5/0/1 with artillery gives support ability). <br>Removed Austrian Cutter. <br>Removed Tower from Constantinople. <br>Changed Madrid Fortress to a Tower. <br>Added a Tower to Catalonia. <br>Gave Spain back 2 pu. <br>Changed Spain's convoy from 16 to 14 (negative NO is now -10, to keep the original income of 4 from the convoy the same). <br> <br> <br>To see previous changes from 2.0 - 3.7, see the comments at the end of the xml file. <br> <br>Original Map and Game, complete to Version 2.0 by LSSAH. <br>Changes 2.0-4.0 by Veqryn (with additional help from Pulicat, Lalapaloza, Cal2). <br>Changes 4.1 by redrum, Last Edited October, 2016.
